TelePath Remote Telehealth Application


Hi!

If you want to run this, go into PoseEstimationApp folder and run the Android application from there. 


Other folders are listed below:
SampleApp - easier than making a dev branch! for risky changes and fast iteration :)
app - React Native components of Wireframe. These are unused, as we pivoted to Android Studio
Components - Refined React Native components of Wireframe. These are unused, as we pivoted to Android Studio
temp - Temporary storage for XML files for editing. 
test_images - Temporary assets for temporary storage of temportay XML files for temporary editing


Files:

converted_model.tflite	- Not the final model, but an easy model to test with. 
hackillinois_highfiedlity.xd - XD files for wireframes
posedetection.mp4	- When we first got the camera to call a model :)
